# Introduction

### Thank you for considering contributing to autostack!

It's people like you that make autostack such a great tool.

### Why you should read these guidelines.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kinds of contributions we are looking for.

Keep an open mind! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into autostack itself.

# Ground rules
Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all of your interactions with the project.

Responsibilities:
* Ensure that code follows the style guide.
* Do not create new classes, if possible. Try to use functions.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
* Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

# Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to autostack? You can start by looking through beginner and help-wanted issues.
* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

# Getting started

To contribute, find an issue, or open an issue, that you want to work on such as a feature request or a bug fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Make the change in your fork.
3. Create a pull request.

Before submitting a contribution, be sure that you have followed all of the ground rules.

Unlike larger contributions, smaller contributions such as spelling errors or comment cleanup do not require an issue. Simply fork the code and create a pull request.
